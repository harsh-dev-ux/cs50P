# CS50P - Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository contains my solutions to Harvard University's CS50P course problem sets. I'm adding projects as I complete them throughout the course.

## ✨ About CS50P

CS50P is Harvard's introduction to programming with Python, covering fundamental programming concepts through hands-on projects including functions, conditionals, loops, exceptions, libraries, testing, file I/O, regular expressions, and object-oriented programming.
